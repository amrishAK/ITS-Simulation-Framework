%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).

I would like to thank Professor Vinny Cahill for his support and guidance throughout this dissertation. The regular meetings, consistent advice helped me to stay on the right course.

I would also like to thank the IT team of the School of Computer Science and Statistics for their help to set up the remote server for this dissertation.

Finally, I would like to say a heartfelt thanks to my family and friends, especially my mom and dad, for backing me every step of the way. I am eternally grateful for every opportunity you have afforded me in life.                        %% acknowledgments; it can be anything

Around the world, lots of countries and people face economical, social and environmental impacts due to traffic congestion. The main reason for the congestion is the increase in traffic demand and over traffic flow in a road network. An effective and efficient solution against congestion is to utilize the road infrastructure to its full capacity. Intelligent Transportation helps (ITS) us to address congestion by continuously monitoring and regulating the traffic flow. It achieves this by establishing cooperation and coordination among the vehicles. These systems must be tested and evaluated in a realistic simulation environment before real-world deployment. 

 The ITS simulation framework current present is purely based on vehicular network simulation, and they lack to address distributed and real-time characteristics of ITS. This dissertation introduces a framework consisting of only Carla simulator to perform distributed ITS simulation. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulating customised ITS application created by extending the designed framework.
